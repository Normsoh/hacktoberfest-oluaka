## How to add a dev
Let start

#### First things first

1. [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
2. [Medium](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940)


#### Next
This is how you can add your profile

* `fork` this `repo` 
* `clone` it to you local machine `git clone "url you just copied"`

#### Create a branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd hacktoberfest-oluaka
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b add-iroleh-vincent
```
(The name of the branch does not need to have the word *add* in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

* open the [data](/data/devs.json) file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it at the bottom. Now, save the file.
